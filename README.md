# Readme
This site is built using Jekyll and GitHub pages.

## Requirements

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), version 2.4.0 or later
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Jekyll does not officially support Windows, although there is an installation guide: [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/).

Ruby can also be installed on Windows Services for Linux with the following command: `sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev`.

To install Jekyll after Ruby has been set up, run the command: `bundle update`.

## Local testing

To test locally, run the command: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
