For sites and web applications to be usable for everyone, it is important to make sure they are as accessible as possible.  

It is important that sites can be used effectively, whatever impairments a user may have, be it vision, hearing, mobility or if they have learning difficulties. 

This is especially important for sites which are used for public consumption, like NHS, Council and government services as well as other public sector organisations.

This site is designed using [NHS.UK frontend](https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/), which has these principles in mind.
